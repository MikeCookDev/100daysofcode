	<header><strong>Day 26</strong></header>
		<p>I've decided that instead of trying to work on projects that are in a way distracting me from best utilizing the time that i have to study just to fill "prove" I did some work on that day, i'm instead going to use this update page everyday just as a post of what i've worked on for that day, especially trying to learn JavaScript. I really wanna learn this language and pick it up so aside from tweaks to this page I will eventually make. Until i am doing projects for JavaScript I will just be using this for a post update.</p>

			<h3>Today I worked on:</h3>

					<li>-Word Blanks</li>
