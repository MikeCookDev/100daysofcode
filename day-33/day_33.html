		<p>I've decided that instead of trying to work on projects that are in a way distracting me from best utilizing the time that i have to study just to fill "prove" I did some work on that day, i'm instead going to use this update page everyday just as a post of what i've worked on for that day, especially trying to learn JavaScript. I really wanna learn this language and pick it up so aside from tweaks to this page I will eventually make. Until i am doing projects for JavaScript I will just be using this for a post update.</p>

			<h3>Today I worked on:</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>-Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation</li>
					<li>-Accessing Object Properties with Variables</li>
					<li>-Updating Object Properties</li>
					<li>-Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object</li>
					<li>-Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object</li>
					<li>-Using Objects for Lookups</li>
				</ul>
