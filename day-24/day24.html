		<p>I've decided that instead of trying to work on projects that are in a way distracting me from best utilizing the time that I have to study just to "prove" I did some work on that day, i'm instead going to use this update page everyday just as a post of what i've worked on for that day, especially trying to learn JavaScript. I really wanna learn this language and pick it up so aside from tweaks to this page I will eventually make. Until I am doing projects for JavaScript I will just be using this for a post update.</p>
