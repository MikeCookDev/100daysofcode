       and a header.

Day 2: A little more practice with forms, lists, anchors, images, paragraphs, and headers, creating a bulbasaur and squirtle page.
       Created a mini project using forms, anchors, images, headers, paragraphs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit button with the            starter page.
       
Day 3: Practice with a little of CSS basics and added some background color, font colors to the checkboxes, aswell as color to the         
       hyperlinks. Added some margin and padding around the images as well as asigning a font-family and size. 
       
Day 4: Very light day of coding for day 4, but I played around with CSS a little more for my mini projects. Added a shadow box for the            images, aswell as practicing with some styling for the fonts including underline and em. 

Day 5: Created a little cheat sheet for colors and their Hex and rgb codes.
       Noticed a bug creating whitespace between the divs, will work on fixing that tomorrow, havent found any resources to tell me what          i'm doing wrong...
      
Day 6: Fixed the bug and removed the whitespace from the code. 
       Removed the ID and added it to the class instead. Also added a few more color selections.
       
Day 7: Added animation on circles so they fade into their set color.
       Set a hover to where it will scale 1.1 times when you hover over it.
