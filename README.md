# 100daysofcode
100daysofcode challenge with freecodecamp

Day 1: Completed The Introduction to basic HTML and HTML5 and created the charmander page using forms, lists, anchors, images, paragraph   
       and a header.

Day 2: A little more practice with forms, lists, anchors, images, paragraphs, and headers, creating a bulbasaur and squirtle page.
       Created a mini project using forms, anchors, images, headers, paragraphs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit button with the            starter page.
       
Day 3: Practice with a little of CSS basics and added some background color, font colors to the checkboxes, aswell as color to the         
       hyperlinks. Added some margin and padding around the images as well as asigning a font-family and size. 
       
Day 4: Very light day of coding for day 4, but I played around with CSS a little more for my mini projects. Added a shadow box for the            images, aswell as practicing with some styling for the fonts including underline and em. 

Day 5: Created a little cheat sheet for colors and their Hex and rgb codes.
       Noticed a bug creating whitespace between the divs, will work on fixing that tomorrow, havent found any resources to tell me what          i'm doing wrong...
      
Day 6: Fixed the bug and removed the whitespace from the code. 
       Removed the ID and added it to the class instead. Also added a few more color selections.
       
Day 7: Added animation on circles so they fade into their set color.
       Set a hover to where it will scale 1.1 times when you hover over it.

Day 8: Created a very minimal project with basic CSS and HTML, animations and some text.

Day 9: Still working through the Responsive Web Design Certification course on freecodecamp.org.
       Did a mini project working with some html and css styling.
       
Day 10: Created a tribute page for freecodecamps projects toward the Responsive Web Design Certification.

Day 11: Began working on the survey form for freecodecamps Responsive Web Design Certification.

Day 12: Not much time to work today with family over, however was able to work a little bit on the survey form..not much and i'm pretty           tired now but i will pick it up again tomorrow.

Day 13: Learn that CSS and design is probably my weakness. Practiced on the survey form, it turned out very ugly, Will work on it more             tomorrow.

Day 14: After some much needed rest i tackled the survery form with a clear mind and was finally able to complete it and im admittedly           very proud of it, despite how basic it is!

Day 15: Began work on project 3 for the Responsive Web Design Certification, a landing page.

Day 16: Continued work on the landing page and practice flexbox and media queries.

Day 17: Continued working on the layout of my landing page, overall not happy with the look or the items i have available to use.               Considering starting a different landing page.

Day 18: Had a mini Ahah! moment and completed the landing page test for the third project of the Responsive Web Design Ceritfication.

Day 19: Create the Skeleton and body of the technical documentation page project.

Day 20: Completed the Technical documentation project. Might make this into a resource for people just wanting the straightforward               basics of web development.
