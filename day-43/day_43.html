	<h3>Iterate with JavaScript While Loops</h3>
		<p>You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.<br>
			The first type of loop is called a "while" loop because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.
		</p>
		<code>
			var ourArray = [];<br>
			var i = 0;<br>
			while(i < 5) {<br>
			  ourArray.push(i);<br>
			  i++;<br>
			}<br>
		</code>


	<h3>Iterate with JavaScript For Loops</h3>
		<p>The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a "for loop" because it runs "for" a specific number of times.</p>

		<p>For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:<br>

			<br><code>for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])</code><br>

			<br>The <em>initialization</em> statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.<br>

			<br>The <em>condition</em> statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.<br>

			<br>The <em>final-expression</em> is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.<br>
		</p>

		<p>In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final-expression.<br>

			<br><code>var ourArray = [];<br>
			for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br>
			  ourArray.push(i);<br>
			}</code><br>

			<br>ourArray will now contain [0,1,2,3,4].<br>
		</p>

		<h3>Iterate Even/Odd Numbers With a For Loop</h3>

			<p>For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.</p>

			<p>start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.<br>

				<br><code>var ourArray = [];<br>
				for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {<br>
				  ourArray.push(i);<br>
				}</code><br>


				<br>ourArray will now contain [0,2,4,6,8].<br>
			</p>

			<h3>Count Backwards With a For Loop</h3>

				<p>A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.</p><br>

				<p>In order to count backwards by twos, we'll need to change our <em>initialization</em>, <em>condition</em>, and <em>final-expression</em>.</p><br>

				<p>start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0.<br>
						decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.<br>
						<code>var ourArray = [];<br>
							  for (var i=10; i > 0; i-=2) {<br>
							  ourArray.push(i);<br>
							  }<br>
						</code>
					</p>
					<p>ourArray will now contain [10,8,6,4,2].</p>

				<h3>Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop</h3>
					<p>A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. <br>One way to do that is with a for loop. <br>This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:<br>

					<br><code>var arr = [10,9,8,7,6];<br>
						for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
						   console.log(arr[i]);<br>
						}<br>
					</code></p>

					<p>Remember that Arrays have zero-based numbering, which means the last index of the array is length - 1.<br> Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops when i is at length - 1.</p><br>

				<h3>Nesting For loops</h3>
					<p>If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior<br> waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:<br>

					<br><code>	var arr = [<br>
						  [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]<br>
						];<br>
						for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
						  for (var j=0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {<br>
						    console.log(arr[i][j]);<br>
						  }<br>
						}<br>
					</code></p>

					<p>This outputs each sub-element in <em>arr</em> one at a time. Note that for the inner loop,<br> we are checking the <em>.length</em> of <em>arr[i]</em>, since <em>arr[i]</em> is itself an array.</p>
